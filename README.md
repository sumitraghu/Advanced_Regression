# Advanced_Regression
## Here, I used the different types of data for better understanding about the Advanced regression.
## Simple Linear Regression: Adverstising dataset
## Multiple Linear Regression: Advertising Dataset
## Modeling non-linear relationships using data transformation: AR - Examples-1.5 (Time and Distance dataset)
## Modeling non-linear relationship using Polynomial Regression: AR- Examples-1.6 (Marks Dataset)

### In the python file, First I checked the relationship between the target and independent variable after that the steps is below :
- Splitting the dataset into X and y
- Building the regression
- Predictions on the basis of model
- Find the value of R-squared
- Visualizing the model fit (Regression plot)
- Model Coefficients: beta0 and beta1 (In the equation of Simple Linear Regression)
- Metrics to assess model performance (RSS, MSE, RMSE)
- Residuals Analysis
- Residuals analysis vs Predictions plots
- Distributions of errors (Distribution plot for check the normality of error of normality)
- Matrix Multiplications ($\widehat{\beta}=(X^{T}.X)^{-1}.X^{T}.Y$)
- Data transformation
